- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BananaBirb,

I am a former Biologist (Background mainly in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, no Ph.D.) who had a brief intermission in publishing before finally deciding to do
something something with computers. 

Interested in -Omics analysis, databanks, organization, basically everything where numbers, management and structure of some sort is involved. 

Currently learning all the tools like Python, the Shell, SQL, R, statistics and so on, since I have no formal statistics or informatics background. 


I was always fond of computers and tinkering with them. Whether in mapping editors or modding games at a a young age, building my own pc, trying to automate plant watering at home or building things in a Co-Making Space.

I am looking to collaborate on anything that is even remotely interesting to me, which includes but is not limited to: vector design, immunology, stem cell biology, 3D-Printing in Biology, developmental/gamete biology, ngs or -omics analyses

You can reach me here or alternatively via
alexander.santel@gmail.com

If we know each other better you might get other options of contact like mobile number, socials, etc. 

Bye and take care,

oh yeah, last but not least, why the stupid name and a Toco Toucan as profile picture? I like animals, also birds. I think octopuses are probably the coolest animals on the earth
but a Toco Toucan is also pretty cool. Its beak looks like a Banana and I used to follow some dude who raised Toucans and made videos about them on youtube, which was my relaxing
program for some time. One of the commenters dubbed the Toucan a "BananaBirb" in true internet l33t speak. I found that name pretty funny and since all my other aliases online are
pretty boring (Lex264somenumber and so on), for some reason I chose this for github. So there you go. 


Be (maybe) seeing you!

Alex
